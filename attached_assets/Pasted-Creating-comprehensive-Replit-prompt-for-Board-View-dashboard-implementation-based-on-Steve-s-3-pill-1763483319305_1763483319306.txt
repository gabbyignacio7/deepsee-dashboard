I've created a comprehensive Replit prompt for implementing the Board View dashboard with Steve's 3 strategic pillars.
View your Board View Implementation Prompt
What This Comprehensive Prompt Includes:
The 3 Strategic Pillars (Steve's Framework):

💰 How We Make Money (Revenue Growth)

Total ARR pipeline, new clients, conversion rates
Top revenue drivers by feature and client
Sales velocity and deal metrics
Revenue by agent type (9 agents)


🛡️ How We Don't Lose Money (Operational Excellence)

ARR at risk gauge ($500K Broadridge)
Critical Tier 0/Tier 1 issues
Cost avoidance and efficiency gains
System uptime, MTTR, incident timeline


🚀 How We Keep Competitive Advantage (Innovation/Moat)

Artemis vs. Keep-Alive work split
Strategic platform roadmap
Competitive positioning (Information Graph, Multi-agent, Microsoft partnership)
Innovation pipeline (R&D → Production)



4 Main Tabs:

Executive Overview - Single-page summary of all 3 pillars
Revenue Growth - Detailed ARR pipeline, conversion metrics, top features
Operational Excellence - Risk dashboard, critical issues, efficiency metrics
Innovation - Artemis progress, strategic roadmap, competitive moats

Key Features:

Automatic Feature Categorization: Logic to assign features to the right pillar(s)
Real-time Metric Calculations: ARR totals, completion rates, risk levels
Visual Components: Progress bars, charts (Recharts), gauges, timelines
Export Functionality: Print to PDF, export data to Excel
Hero Metrics: Big numbers at top of each view for immediate impact
Color-Coded Pillars: Green (Revenue), Orange (Operations), Purple (Innovation)

Complete Code Examples:

Full React/TypeScript components
Helper functions for metric calculations
CSS styling for board-level presentation
Data filtering and categorization logic

Timeline:

Week 1 (Nov 18-22): Executive Overview + Revenue Growth
Week 2 (Nov 25-29): Operations + Innovation + Final review
Ready: Before Steve returns (Monday after Thanksgiving)

What Makes This Board-Level:
Unlike the technical/internal dashboard, this view:

Uses business language (ARR, revenue, risk) instead of technical terms
Shows outcomes (money made/protected) not just features completed
Designed for non-technical stakeholders (board members, investors)
Emphasizes strategic positioning and competitive advantage
Export-ready for presentations

The prompt is comprehensive (12 parts!) and ready to paste directly into Replit AI Agent. It includes everything needed to build a C-suite/board-ready dashboard that translates your technical work into business outcomes.
This addresses Ryan's priority #1 and will be ready for Steve's review when he returns!
