Brandon flagged that Kalvin shows fewer tickets and story points than actual.

POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES TO CHECK:

1. Dashboard filtering to Collective Board only (shows ~5-6 of Kalvin's tickets) instead of full Sprint 2025-S1 (19 tickets)

2. Data source mismatch:
   - Collective Board: ~5-6 Kalvin tickets visible
   - JQL Sprint 2025-S1: 19 Kalvin tickets

3. Sprint filter not correctly applied in data pull

---

FIX OPTIONS:

OPTION A: Align to Collective Board (Brandon's source of truth)
- Show only tickets visible on Collective Board Active Sprints
- Kalvin would show ~5-6 tickets
- This matches Brandon's 89-ticket view

OPTION B: Show full JQL data
- Show all 19 Kalvin tickets in Sprint 2025-S1
- Includes Dependabot/security updates not on Collective Board
- Total would be 121 tickets (not 89)

RECOMMENDATION: Option A - align to Collective Board per Brandon's direction. But verify which Kalvin tickets appear on Collective Board Active Sprints view and show those.

---

STORY POINTS NOTE:

Low story points (4 total) is accurate - most of Kalvin's tickets are unpointed Dependabot/security updates. This is a pointing practice issue, not a dashboard bug.

If you want to display workload more accurately:
- Count tickets as primary metric (19 total, 6 active)
- Show story points as secondary (4 total, 1 active)
- Or add a note: "X tickets unpointed"

---

VERIFICATION AFTER FIX:

Kalvin's bar in "Workload by Engineer (Story Points)" chart should reflect:
- If counting SP only: 4 total (will appear small)
- If counting tickets: 19 total (will appear larger)

Consider adding a toggle: "View by Story Points" vs "View by Ticket Count"
