Here's the comprehensive Replit prompt to update the dashboard data:

---

```
Hi Replit Agent,

I need you to update the hardcoded engineer allocation data in our existing dashboard with fresh JIRA data I just extracted. The dashboard infrastructure is already built - we just need to update the data file.

================================================================================
WHAT TO DO:
================================================================================

Update the file: client/src/data/engineerAllocationData.ts

Replace the existing data with the new data below, keeping the same structure.

================================================================================
NEW DATA TO USE (November 23, 2025):
================================================================================

Replace the entire engineerAllocationData constant with this:

```typescript
export const engineerAllocationData = {
  lastUpdated: "November 23, 2025 2:30 PM",
  
  engineers: [

================================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
================================================================================

**Step 1:** Open client/src/data/engineerAllocationData.ts

**Step 2:** Replace the ENTIRE engineerAllocationData constant with the new data above

**Step 3:** Keep the export statement: `export const engineerAllocationData = ...`

**Step 4:** Update the lastUpdated timestamp to: "November 23, 2025 2:30 PM"

**Step 5:** Verify the file saves correctly with no syntax errors

**Step 6:** Restart the application to load the new data

**Step 7:** Test the dashboard to ensure:
- Summary cards show updated totals
- Engineer list shows 6 engineers (not 10)
- Bar chart displays correctly
- Clicking on engineers shows their updated tickets
- JIRA links still work
- Filters and sorting still work

================================================================================
EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER UPDATE:
================================================================================

Summary Cards should show:
- Total Engineers: 6 (down from 10)
- Total Active Tickets: ~24 (down from 29)
- Total Story Points: 5 (only from BACK-1224)

Top Engineers by Ticket Count:
1. Lane Terry: 7 tickets (1 with 5 story points)
2. Jeff Hegerhorst: 6 tickets (2 in Code Review, 1 Blocked)
3. Loris D'Acunto: 6 tickets (all In Progress, no estimates)
4. Ivan Peev: 2 tickets
5. Konnor Willison: 2 tickets
6. Kannal Mutharasu: 1 ticket

Critical Status Updates:
- SC-299 Progress: 3 completed, 2 in code review, 9 still to do
- BACK-1224: Now 58 days in progress (up from 54)
- Most tickets still have no story point estimates

================================================================================
TESTING CHECKLIST:
================================================================================

After update, verify:
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] "Last Updated: November 23, 2025 2:30 PM" displays in header
- [ ] Only 6 engineers appear in the list
- [ ] Lane Terry shows 7 tickets when expanded
- [ ] Jeff Hegerhorst shows SC-305 and SC-306 in Code Review
- [ ] BACK-1224 shows 58 days with red warning
- [ ] Bar chart shows engineers in correct order
- [ ] Filters work (try filtering by "Code Review" status)
- [ ] Search works (try searching "Jeff")
- [ ] All JIRA links open correctly

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
================================================================================

1. Open the data file
2. Replace the data
3. Save the file
4. Check for TypeScript/syntax errors
5. Restart the dev server
6. Test the dashboard
7. Confirm all features work
8. Report completion

Begin implementation now. Thank you!
