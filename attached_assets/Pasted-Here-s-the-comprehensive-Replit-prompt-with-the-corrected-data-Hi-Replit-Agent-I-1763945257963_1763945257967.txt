Here's the comprehensive Replit prompt with the corrected data:

Hi Replit Agent,

I need you to update the hardcoded engineer allocation data in our existing dashboard with the COMPLETE and ACCURATE JIRA data we just extracted. The November 23 initial extraction was incomplete - it only captured In Progress tickets. This is the full comprehensive dataset.

================================================================================
CRITICAL CONTEXT:
================================================================================

Previous extractions were INCOMPLETE:
- Nov 19: Had estimated/demo data (10 engineers, 158 story points)
- Nov 23 (first attempt): Only captured In Progress tickets (6 engineers, 5 story points)
- Nov 23 (comprehensive): Complete extraction across ALL statuses (REAL DATA)

New findings:
- 569 total active tickets (not 121!)
- 186 tickets HAVE story points (not 5!)
- 118 To Do tickets with assignees were missed
- 18 Code Review tickets were missed
- Story points ARE being tracked in JIRA

================================================================================
WHAT TO DO:
================================================================================

Update the file: client/src/data/engineerAllocationData.ts

Replace the existing data with the NEW COMPLETE data below.

================================================================================
NEW COMPLETE DATA (November 23, 2025 7:30 PM EST / 5:30 PM MT):
================================================================================

Replace the entire engineerAllocationData constant with this:

```typescript
export const engineerAllocationData = {

================================================================================
KEY CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS:
================================================================================

**COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION vs. NOV 23 INCOMPLETE:**

**Total Active Work (REAL DATA):**
- 569 total active tickets across all statuses (not 121!)
- 186 tickets WITH story points (not 5!)
- 118 To Do tickets with assignees
- 18 Code Review tickets
- 16 Blocked tickets

**Engineers: 10 CONFIRMED (not 6):**
1. Lane Terry: 8 tickets, 63 story points (5 In Progress, 1 Code Review, 2 To Do)
2. Aleksander Winski: 4 tickets, 31 story points (1 In Progress, 1 Code Review, 1 To Do, 1 Waiting)
3. Jeff Hegerhorst: 6 tickets, 37 story points (2 Code Review, 1 In Progress, 1 Blocked, 2 To Do)
4. Darius Ouderkirk: 4 tickets, 31 story points (1 Code Review, 2 In Progress, 1 To Do)
5. Anna Kamionowska: 6 tickets, 47 story points (1 In Progress, 1 Code Review, 4 To Do)
6. Ivan Peev: 3 tickets, 18 story points (2 In Progress, 1 Code Review)
7. Kannal Mutharasu: 3 tickets, 13 story points (2 Code Review, 1 In Progress)
8. Konnor Willison: 2 tickets, 13 story points (2 In Progress)
9. Kalvin Willison: 3 tickets, 11 story points (3 Code Review)
10. Loris D'Acunto: 6 tickets, 0 story points (6 In Progress, no estimates)

**Total Story Points: 264 (not 5, not 158!)**

**Why Numbers Changed:**

Nov 19 (158 pts): Partial estimate, some real data
Nov 23 incomplete (5 pts): Only captured In Progress, missed 118 To Do tickets and 18 Code Review tickets
Nov 23 complete (264 pts): ALL statuses included (In Progress, To Do, Code Review, Blocked, Waiting)

**SC-299 Broadridge Security Update:**
- SC-302 (PostgreSQL): COMPLETED ✓
- SC-305 (NATS): Code Review with Jeff (8 pts)
- SC-306 (Argo Events): Code Review with Jeff (8 pts)
- SC-308 (Argo CLI): COMPLETED ✓
- SC-309 (Argo Workflow): COMPLETED ✓
- 9 sub-tasks still To Do, unassigned

**Story Points ARE TRACKED:**
- 186 tickets have story points in JIRA
- This is NOT estimated data - this is REAL from JIRA
- DeepSee actively uses story points for capacity planning

**Long-Running Tickets:**
- BACK-1224 (Lane): 58 days (was 54, now 58)
- BACK-1382 (Darius): 27 days (was 23, now 27)
- BACK-1117 (Darius): 36 days (was 32, now 36) - NOW IN CODE REVIEW!
- BACK-1196 (Lane): 74 days in To Do

================================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
================================================================================

**Step 1:** Open client/src/data/engineerAllocationData.ts

**Step 2:** Replace the ENTIRE engineerAllocationData constant with the new data above

**Step 3:** Update the lastUpdated timestamp to: "November 23, 2025 7:30 PM EST"

**Step 4:** Verify the file saves correctly with no syntax errors

**Step 5:** Restart the application to load the new data

**Step 6:** Test the dashboard to ensure:
- Summary cards show updated totals (10 engineers, ~43 tickets shown, 264 story points)
- Bar chart displays correctly with proper color coding
- All engineers appear in the list
- Clicking on engineers shows their complete ticket breakdown (all statuses)
- Status badges show correctly (In Progress, To Do, Code Review, Blocked, Waiting)
- JIRA links work
- Filters work (try "Code Review" status filter - should show 7 engineers)
- Sort by story points shows Lane Terry first (63 pts)

================================================================================
EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER UPDATE:
================================================================================

**Summary Cards:**
- Total Engineers: 10 (back to original count!)
- Total Active Tickets: ~43 (tickets shown for these 10 engineers)
- Average Story Points: 26.4 per engineer
- Total Story Points: 264

**Top Engineers by Story Points:**
1. Lane Terry: 63 pts (8 tickets - mix of statuses)
2. Anna Kamionowska: 47 pts (6 tickets - mostly To Do/In Progress)
3. Jeff Hegerhorst: 37 pts (6 tickets - mix including 2 in Code Review)
4. Aleksander Winski: 31 pts (4 tickets)
5. Darius Ouderkirk: 31 pts (4 tickets)
6. Ivan Peev: 18 pts (3 tickets)
7. Kannal Mutharasu: 13 pts (3 tickets)
8. Konnor Willison: 13 pts (2 tickets)
9. Kalvin Willison: 11 pts (3 tickets in Code Review)
10. Loris D'Acunto: 0 pts (6 tickets, no estimates)

**Status Distribution:**
- In Progress: Multiple engineers
- Code Review: 7 engineers have tickets here
- To Do: Multiple engineers
- Blocked: Jeff (1 ticket)
- Waiting: Aleksander (1 ticket)

**Critical Highlights:**
- BACK-1224: 58 days (red warning)
- BACK-1382: 27 days (orange warning)
- BACK-1117: 36 days but NOW in Code Review (progress!)
- BACK-1196: 74 days in To Do (red warning)

================================================================================
TESTING CHECKLIST:
================================================================================

After update, verify:
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] "Last Updated: November 23, 2025 7:30 PM EST" displays in header
- [ ] All 10 engineers appear in the list
- [ ] Bar chart shows Lane Terry with longest bar (~63 pts)
- [ ] Color coding: Lane/Anna/Jeff in orange/red (heavy load)
- [ ] Click Lane Terry → Shows 8 tickets across multiple statuses
- [ ] Click Jeff Hegerhorst → Shows SC-305 and SC-306 in Code Review
- [ ] Click Anna Kamionowska → Shows FB (ML) tickets
- [ ] Filter by "Code Review" status → Shows 7 engineers
- [ ] Filter by "To Do" status → Shows multiple engineers
- [ ] Search "Darius" → Shows only Darius
- [ ] BACK-1224 shows red warning icon (58 days)
- [ ] All JIRA links open correctly
- [ ] Export CSV works and includes all statuses

================================================================================
COMPARISON SUMMARY FOR MEETING:
================================================================================

**What We Learned:**
1. Story points ARE actively tracked (186 tickets have them)
2. Initial Nov 23 extraction was too narrow (only In Progress)
3. Complete extraction shows healthy distribution across statuses
4. All 10 engineers are active with varied workloads
5. 264 total story points across active work

**Key Metrics for Head of Engineering:**
- Team capacity: 264 story points in flight
- Average load: 26.4 points per engineer
- Status breakdown: Good mix of In Progress, Code Review, To Do
- Broadridge security: 3 completed, 2 in code review, 9 remaining
- Long-running items: 4 tickets over 30 days need attention

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
================================================================================

1. Open the data file
2. Replace with complete data
3. Verify timestamp: "November 23, 2025 7:30 PM EST"
4. Save the file
5. Check for TypeScript errors
6. Restart dev server
7. Test all features
8. Take screenshot of updated dashboard
9. Report completion

Begin implementation now. This is the COMPLETE and ACCURATE data!
