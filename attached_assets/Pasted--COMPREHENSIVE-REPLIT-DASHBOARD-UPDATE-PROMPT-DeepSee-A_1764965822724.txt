# COMPREHENSIVE REPLIT DASHBOARD UPDATE PROMPT
## DeepSee AI Prioritization Dashboard - Board View Enhancement

---

## OBJECTIVE
Update the DeepSee dashboard to include Steve's Board View requirements and Ryan's three-bucket categorization from Column D of the Master_Data_Features Excel sheet. The dashboard must serve both internal stakeholders (Engineering, Product) and external stakeholders (Board, Steve).

---

## STEVE'S 5 BOARD VIEW REQUIREMENTS

The Board View tab must display:

1. **Roadmap Delivered vs Plan**
   - Show planned features by quarter (NOW/NEXT/LATER) vs actual completion status
   - Visual progress tracker comparing planned vs delivered

2. **Adoption of Top Value-Driving Features/Workflows**
   - Highlight features with highest ARR impact
   - Show adoption rates by client

3. **Reliability/Security Milestones (Enterprise Readiness)**
   - Track security vulnerability remediation progress
   - Show compliance/audit readiness status
   - Display infrastructure stability metrics

4. **Implementation Time Trend; Time-to-First-Value**
   - Track deployment duration from start to production
   - Show client onboarding velocity

5. **Support Volume and SLA Attainment**
   - Track support ticket trends
   - Display SLA compliance metrics

---

## RYAN'S THREE-BUCKET FRAMEWORK (FROM COLUMN D)

Features are categorized into three strategic buckets:

| Bucket | Count | Board Question | Description |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Make Money** | 45 | "How do we make money?" | Revenue-generating client activities, new contracts |
| **Don't Lose Money** | 12 | "How do we not lose money?" | Speed improvements, retention, client risk mitigation |
| **Innovation** | 17 | "How do we keep competitive advantage?" | Information graph, blueprint, cross-platform capabilities |

### Summary Statistics
- Total Features: 74
- Total JIRA Tickets: 2,662 (across 6 projects: BACK, CI, FB, UI, SC, PR)
- Sales Pipeline Opportunities: 16
- ARR at Risk (Tier 0): $500K (Broadridge)

### Bucket Summary

| LATER | 12 | 16% |

---

## DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS

### NEW TAB: Board View
Create a new tab called "Board View" with the following components:

#### 1. Strategic Bucket Overview (Hero Section)
- Three large KPI cards showing each bucket:
  - **Make Money** (green): 45 features | $X ARR potential
  - **Don't Lose** (yellow/amber): 12 features | $500K at risk
  - **Innovation** (blue): 17 features | Competitive advantage

#### 2. Roadmap Delivered vs Plan Chart
- Horizontal bar chart or timeline showing:
  - X-axis: NOW | NEXT | LATER
  - Y-axis: Feature count
  - Color-coded by bucket (Make/Don't Lose/Innovation)
  - Show completion % for each quarter

#### 3. Feature Adoption Matrix
- Heat map or grid showing:
  - Rows: Top clients (Broadridge, DTCC, JP Morgan, Accenture, Regional Banks)
  - Columns: Agent types
  - Cell values: Feature count / adoption status

#### 4. Security & Reliability Progress
- Progress bars showing:
  - Critical vulnerabilities: X/Y resolved
  - High vulnerabilities: X/Y resolved
  - Infrastructure upgrades: status

#### 5. Time-to-Value Metrics
- Line chart showing:
  - Average deployment duration trend
  - Client onboarding velocity

#### 6. Filters
- Bucket filter (Make/Don't Lose/Innovation)
- Quarter filter (NOW/NEXT/LATER)
- Client filter
- Agent Type filter

---

## EXISTING TABS TO UPDATE

### Engineering View
- Add bucket column visualization
- Show features by bucket breakdown
- Sprint velocity by bucket

### Product Roadmap View
- Add bucket column
- Color-code features by bucket
- Filter by bucket

### Executive Dashboard
- Add bucket summary widgets
- Show ARR by bucket
- Display Tier 0 alerts prominently

---

## PRIORITY SCORING FORMULA (EXISTING)

```
Priority_Score = (ARR × Replicability × Conversion_Probability) / (Effort_Weeks × Confidence_Factor)
```

Where:
- Confidence_Factor: 1 (High), 1.5 (Medium), 2-3 (Low)

---

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

1. **Color Scheme**:
   - Make Money: #28a745 (green)
   - Don't Lose: #ffc107 (amber)
   - Innovation: #007bff (blue)
   - Tier 0 Alert: #dc3545 (red)

2. **Password Protection**: Dashboard is password protected (password shared via DM)

3. **Data Source**: Excel file at `2025-11-07-DeepSee-prioritization-dashboard-v3__4_.xlsx`

4. **Update Frequency**: Dashboard should auto-refresh or allow manual refresh

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After implementation, confirm:
- [ ] Board View tab created with all 5 Steve requirements
- [ ] Three-bucket filtering works (Make/Don't Lose/Innovation)
- [ ] All 74 features are displayed correctly
- [ ] Bucket distribution matches (45/12/17)
- [ ] Quarter distribution matches (40/22/12)
- [ ] Tier 0 alert is prominently displayed for Broadridge ($500K at risk)
- [ ] Color coding is consistent across all views
- [ ] Filters work correctly
- [ ] Existing tabs updated with bucket column
