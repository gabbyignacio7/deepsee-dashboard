Got it - you need to add this 7-pillar architecture view as a new tab/section to your existing DeepSee prioritization dashboard. Let me craft the prompt for that:

---

**REPLIT PROMPT: Add Architecture Progress View to Existing Dashboard**

---

**OBJECTIVE:**
Add a new tab/section called "Platform Architecture" to the existing DeepSee Prioritization Dashboard that maps features to 7 platform architecture pillars and shows progress with Now | Next | Later status.

---

**NEW DATA COLUMN TO ADD:**

In the existing Excel/data source, add a new column:

```
Architecture_Layer (dropdown values 1-7):
1 = DeepSee Service Fabric
2 = Orchestration Layer
3 = PRIMER Agents
4 = Blueprint Catalog
5 = Agentic Engine + DeepGraph
6 = Compliance-First Assurance
7 = Agent-First SaS
```

---

**NEW TAB/VIEW TO CREATE:**

**Tab Name:** "Platform Architecture" or "7 Pillars"

**Layout:**

**Row 1 - Summary Bar:**
- Overall Platform Progress: [calculated average across 7 layers]
- Pillars at Threshold: X/7

**Row 2 - Seven Pillar Cards (horizontal or 2x4 grid):**

Each card displays:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [1] DeepSee Service Fabric      │
│ ████████░░ 80%                  │
│ ✓ Production Ready              │
│ Features: 5 | Tickets: 12/15    │
│ Now: 3 | Next: 2 | Later: 0     │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Row 3 - Detail Table (filtered by selected pillar):**

When user clicks a pillar card, table below filters to show:
| Feature_ID | Feature_Name | Status | Quarter | JIRA Tickets | Progress |
|------------|--------------|--------|---------|--------------|----------|

---

**CALCULATIONS (using existing data + new column):**

```javascript
// Progress per Layer
Layer_Progress = SUM(Tickets_Done WHERE Architecture_Layer = X) / SUM(JIRA_Ticket_Count WHERE Architecture_Layer = X) * 100

// Threshold Status
if (Layer_Progress >= 70) return "✓ Production Ready"
if (Layer_Progress >= 50) return "⚡ Near Threshold"
else return "○ In Development"

// Status counts per layer
Now_Count = COUNT(Features WHERE Architecture_Layer = X AND Status = "Now")
Next_Count = COUNT(Features WHERE Architecture_Layer = X AND Status = "Next")
Later_Count = COUNT(Features WHERE Architecture_Layer = X AND Status = "Later")
```

---

**MAPPING LOGIC:**

Pull from existing dashboard data:
- `Feature_ID`, `Feature_Name` → from Master_Data_Features
- `Status` → derive from Quarter_Planned vs current date (Q4 2025 = Now, Q1 2026 = Next, Q2+ = Later)
- `JIRA_Ticket_Count`, `Tickets_Done` → from JIRA data tab
- `Architecture_Layer` → NEW column to add

---

**STATUS DERIVATION (if not manually set):**

```javascript
// Auto-derive Status from Quarter
current_quarter = "Q4 2025"

if (Quarter_Planned <= current_quarter) Status = "Now"
else if (Quarter_Planned == next_quarter) Status = "Next"  // Q1 2026
else Status = "Later"  // Q2 2026+
```

---

**STYLING:**

Match existing dashboard theme. Progress bar colors:
- Green: Now (complete/in production)
- Yellow/Orange: Next (in development)
- Gray: Later (roadmap)

Threshold markers:
- ✓ Green checkmark: ≥70%
- ⚡ Yellow bolt: 50-69%
- ○ Gray circle: <50%

---

**INTEGRATION POINTS:**

1. Add "Platform Architecture" as new tab in navigation
2. New column `Architecture_Layer` in Master_Data_Features sheet
3. Calculations reference existing JIRA ticket data
4. Clicking pillar card filters existing feature table

---

**DEFAULT LAYER MAPPINGS (pre-populate based on feature names):**

| Feature Pattern | Default Layer |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Contains "Service Fabric" or "Connector" or "Integration Gateway" | 1 |
| Contains "Reasoning" or "Orchestration" or "MCP" or "Planning" | 2 |
| Contains "Agent" (Email, Trade, SSI, etc.) | 3 |
| Contains "Blueprint" or "Template" or "Configuration" | 4 |
| Contains "Graph" or "DeepGraph" or "Playbook" | 5 |
| Contains "Compliance" or "Audit" or "HITL" or "Testing" | 6 |
| Contains "UI" or "Dashboard" or "UX" | 7 |
