Update the DeepSee Dashboard (https://deepsee-dashboard-v1.replit.app) with the following data. This aligns to the Collective Board Active Sprints view per Brandon's direction.

CRITICAL FIXES:
1. Ticket counts must match Collective Board (89 total, not 121)
2. Story points must update correctly - Kalvin specifically shows less than actual
3. Engineer allocation view must reflect Active Sprints data

ENGINEER WORKLOAD (Active - Not Done):

| Engineer | To Do | Blocked | In Prog | Code Rev | Total Active | Story Points |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Lane Terry | 2 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 4 | [calculate] |
| Darius Ouderkirk | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 10 (5+5) |
| Jeff Hegerhorst | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 8+ |

KALVIN WILLISON FIX (Brandon flagged this specifically):

Current dashboard shows less than actual. His real workload:

| Ticket | Summary | Status | Story Points |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| BACK-1489 | Update classification-api Base Image | Blocked | 1 |
| BACK-1580 | Update dependencies: 8 Dependabot PRs | In Progress | - |
| BACK-1586 | Update node-forge | In Progress | - |
| BACK-1589 | Update starlette | Code Review | - |

Plus completed work (Done):
| Ticket | Summary | Story Points |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| BACK-1570 | Test HMDA Mercury Extraction End-to-End | 3 |
| (others) | ... | ... |

Total Active: 4 tickets
Ensure story points sum correctly for Kalvin.

---

ENGINEER COMPLETED (Done):

| Engineer | Done Count | Done Story Points |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Lane Terry | [count from Done list] | [sum SP] |
| Darius Ouderkirk | [count] | [sum] |
| Jeff Hegerhorst | [count] | [sum] |
| Aleksander Winski | [count] | [sum] |
| Kalvin Willison | [count] | [sum] |
| Ivan Peev | [count] | [sum] |
| Matthew Snow | [count] | [sum] |
| Owen Riley | [count] | [sum] |
| Treven Trujillo | [count] | [sum] |
| Konnor Willison | [count] | [sum] |
| Kannal Mutharasu | [count] | [sum] |
| Chad Hegerhorst | [count] | [sum] |

---

PART 9: REMOVE / EXCLUDE

---

EXCLUDE from dashboard (tracked separately per Brandon):
- SC (Security) project tickets (being cleaned up by Brandon)
- Loris and Manuel work (outside sprint process per Ryan)

REMOVE these alerts (no longer accurate):
- "FB-2407 NEEDS OWNER" (now has owner, To Do)
- "BACK-1318 in review 9+ days" (now Done)
- "2 BLOCKED" (now only 1)

---

PART 10: DATA SOURCE NOTE

---

Add footer note to dashboard:

"Source: DeepSee Collective Board > Active sprints (89 tickets)
Last Updated: December 15, 2025 @ [timestamp] MT
Note: SC (Security) tickets tracked separately."

---

PART 11: STORY POINTS CALCULATION FIX

---

The allocation view story points are not calculating correctly.

Known story points from extraction:

| Ticket | Story Points |
|--------|--------------|
| BACK-1548 | 5 |
| BACK-1572 | 5 |
| BACK-1573 | 5 |
| BACK-1489 | 1 |
| BACK-1521 | 3 |
| BACK-1488 | 1 |
| UI-701 | 5 |
| CI-436 | 8 |
| BACK-1570 | 3 |
| UI-712 | 2 |
| UI-693 | 5 |
| BACK-1436 | 5 |

Check that:
1. Story points are being pulled from JIRA correctly
2. Story points are summing for each engineer
3. Kalvin's story points include all his tickets (Brandon flagged this)

---

PART 12: PROJECTS INCLUDED

---

Only include these projects (Collective Board scope):

| Project | Include | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| BACK | ✅ Yes | Primary backend work |
| UI | ✅ Yes | Frontend work |
| CI | ✅ Yes | Infrastructure |
| FB | ✅ Yes | Filbert |
| PR | ✅ Yes | Product Roadmap |
| SC | ❌ No | Tracked separately (Brandon cleaning up) |

---

SUMMARY OF CHANGES:

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| Total Tickets | 118 → 89 |
| Done | 59 → 56 |
| Completion % | 50% → 63% |
| Blocked | 2 → 1 |
| Unassigned | 29 → 7 |
| Health | YELLOW → GREEN |
| Data Source | JQL all projects → Collective Board Active Sprints |
| Story Points | FIX calculation for all engineers, especially Kalvin |
