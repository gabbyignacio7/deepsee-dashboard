**Let's go with Option A - High-Impact Quick Wins.**

Start with these three in this order:

**1. Confidence Factor Integration** (Highest Priority)
- This was explicitly requested by Nick in the meeting and approved by Ryan
- It directly affects the priority score formula which is the core of the entire framework
- Relatively straightforward to implement

**2. Artemis Work Tracking** (Second Priority)  
- Ryan specifically requested this in our 1-on-1 - it's critical for him to show the team is working on strategic platform work, not just "keep alive" maintenance
- This affects executive visibility and stakeholder communication
- Needs to be ready for weekly prioritization meetings

**3. Heat Map Visualization** (Third Priority)
- Already in the original demo, team liked it
- Helps identify quick wins vs. questionable features
- Good visual for meetings

**For now, defer:**
- Sprint Sequencing (we're still at 60% data accuracy, sprints come later)
- PRD/Epic Tracking (nice to have but not blocking anything)
- Client/Deployment views (can add after the core framework is stable)

**Implementation Notes:**
- For Confidence Factor: Default all existing features to 2 (Medium) in the data
- For Artemis Tracking: I'll manually tag which features are Artemis vs. Keep-Alive after you add the field
- For Heat Map: Use Recharts ScatterChart (already in dependencies)

Let's focus on getting these three working well rather than trying to do everything at once. Once these are solid, we can tackle the next batch.

**Can you start with implementing the Confidence Factor integration first? Let me know when you're ready and I'll provide the updated feature data with confidence values.**
